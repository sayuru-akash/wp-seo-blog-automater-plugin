  - Added proper error handling in `check_for_update()` method
- 🎨 **Button Hover Fix**: Fixed white secondary buttons where text became invisible on hover
  - Changed hover state to maintain white background with better contrast
  - Text color now uses `var(--primary-dark)` instead of `var(--primary-color)` on hover
  - Enhanced shadow on hover for better visual feedback
  - Fixed ::before pseudo-element gradient for smoother transitions

### Changed

- 🔧 Enhanced error debugging in JavaScript with detailed console logging
- 📝 Improved error messages to include browser console reference

### Added

- ✅ **Test Suite**: Created `tests/test-github-api.php` for API connectivity verification
  - Standalone PHP script to test GitHub API endpoint
  - Validates response structure and asset availability
  - Helps diagnose update system issues

### Technical

- Enhanced AJAX error callback with xhr, status, and error details
- Improved WP_Error handling throughout the update chain

### Why This Version Bump

Moving to 1.1.0 (minor version) because:
- Contains important bug fixes that affect core functionality
- Includes backward-compatible improvements
- Provides better testing and debugging capabilities
- Follows semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

## [1.0.8] - 2026-01-20

### ⚡ Instant Update Check Release

Added immediate update checking functionality for better user control and transparency.

### Added

- ✨ **Instant Update Check**: "Check for Updates Now" button on System Info page
  - Immediate GitHub API check without waiting for 12-hour automatic cycle
  - Clear transient cache and fetch fresh release data
  - Real-time version comparison and display update
  - Loading state with spinning icon for visual feedback
  - Success/error messages with auto-fade after 5 seconds
  - Updates both display and WordPress update system
- 🔄 **Dynamic Version Display**: Version numbers update in real-time after check
- 📝 **Activity Logging**: All manual update checks logged for tracking
- 🎨 **Enhanced UI**: Animated dashicons during loading state

### Changed

- 🔧 System Info page now has interactive update checking
- 🎯 Update status notices refresh dynamically without page reload
- 💫 Better user feedback with immediate visual response

### Technical

- New AJAX handler: `ajax_check_updates_now()` in admin class
- Clears both `wp_seo_automater_github_release` and `update_plugins` transients
- JavaScript handler with error handling and timeout protection
- Added `admin_url` to localized script data for proper URL construction
- CSS animation for spinning dashicons
- Permission check: requires `update_plugins` capability
- Network error handling with user-friendly messages

### Why This Matters

Users wanted immediate control over update checking instead of waiting up to 12 hours for the automatic system. This gives power users the ability to:

- Check for updates on-demand after seeing a GitHub release notification
- Verify update availability immediately after releasing a new version
- Confirm the update system is working correctly
- Get instant feedback without waiting for WordPress cron

### Security

- Nonce verification on AJAX requests
- Capability check for `update_plugins` permission
- Sanitized output and escaped data throughout

## [1.0.7] - 2026-01-20

### 📋 System Info Page Release

Added dedicated System Info page for better update visibility and system monitoring.

### Added

- ✨ **System Info Page**: New menu item showing plugin and system status
  - Current vs. Latest version display
  - Update availability notification with direct link to update
  - System requirements check (PHP, WordPress, API keys)

  - Where to find updates in WordPress (Dashboard, Plugins page, Toolbar)
  - Update schedule explanation (12-hour checks)
  - Direct links to GitHub releases and WordPress updates page
  - Plugin details display (Name, Author, URI, Text Domain)
- 🎨 **New UI Components**: Info grids, notice boxes, status badges
- 📖 **In-App Documentation**: Users can now see update status without leaving the plugin

### Why This Matters

Users were confused about where to find updates since the GitHub updater integrates with WordPress's native system (not a separate page in the plugin menu). The new System Info page provides clear visibility into:

- Whether an update is available
- Where to go to update (Dashboard → Updates or Plugins page)
- How the automatic update system works
- System compatibility status

### Technical

- New file: `admin/partials/system-info-display.php`
